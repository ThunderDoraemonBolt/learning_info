## Exam Questions and Answers ##
> __Question 1__
>

>

>

>
> __Answer__
>
> Among all of these issues, I think the widely accepted understanding of a divided Korea into a communist North and a capitalist South is the most problematic and misleading.
>
> In our widely accepted understanding of a divided Korea into the communist North and capitalist South, we are usually taught by the mainstream news such as the New York Times and BBC how poor and isolated communist North Korea is while how wealthy and free capitalist South Korea. Besides, they often tell us how brainwashed the North Korean people are or how totalitarian the North Korean government is, most news reports are negative toward North Korea while most news reports are positive toward South Korea. This is very problematic and misleading since most of us do not exactly know how North Korea is but have already been told by the mainstream media how bad North Korea is and how relatively good South Korea is. We can observe how problematic and misleading it is through the documentaries and readings relating to North Korea.
>
> Even though North Korea has a tight ideology of communism, they experience the same daily lives as the people outside of North Korea. As we can observe from the documentary “My Brothers and Sisters in the North”, most North Korean people go swimming during their holidays and the students have different kinds of classes such as History and Arts. The only difference from the normal class outside North Korea is that they are taught with Kim Il-sung's Ideology. Moreover, in the lectures, we know that North Koreans have their daily lives such as sightseeing, going on a picnic, and having a Western wedding. Furthermore, in the readings, we can observe that North Korean consumerism is similar to that in Western countries. There is a wide range of products and shopping centers like the Kwangbok Area Shopping Center use the format of a supermarket and checkout by scanning into the electronic cash register. It may be true that some of the North Korean people are poor, and only those in Pyongyang will be wealthier, or their ideological values are controlled to be loyal to the Great Leaders, but North Korea is not as isolated as told by the media. Instead, North Korean people have a lot of similar leisure events to Western societies, and South Korea. We can conclude that North Korea is not isolated but improving even though it sticks to its communist values.
>
> On the other side, South Korea has experienced some negative events after the split of the North and South. For example, in the movie “Taxi Driver”, Chun Doo-hwan government brutally oppressed the protestors gaining their human rights in Gwangju Uprising, controlled the news reports and falsely named them the communists, but fortunately the footages were recorded by the German journalist Jurgen Hinzpeter. Besides, in the lecture, we know that the former South Korean presidents had been questioned, prosecuted, and charged. However, these will not be reported a lot by the mainstream media. They usually report how South Korea and the U.S. prepared against North Korea. Therefore, the people in the West will generally believe that South Korea is good and North Korea is bad.
> 
> This is why I believe that the widely accepted understandings of a divided Korea into a communist North and a capitalist South are problematic and misleading around the world. We need to correct their views on this issue.

> __Question 2__
>
> Explain the historical origins of where this issue/misconception comes from and why it is still widely accepted today.
>

> __Answer__
>
> This misconception mainly comes from the fact that the Cold War began between the USA and the USSR from 1945 to 1991, when the USSR collapsed. The Korean War also happened in this period. The USSR and Eastern Europe supported North Korea while the USA and Western Europe supported South Korea. After the ceasefire between North Korea and South Korea in 1953, leading to the split of the communist North and capitalist South, the USA and USSR both operated a series of indirect wars against each other, such as propaganda wars and space wars. Propaganda wars still affect us a lot today. The most notable propaganda war was the Kitchen Dabate in 1959, in which the USSR leader Khruschev and USA vice-president Nixon debated the pros and cons of capitalism and communism. After the USSR collapsed in 1991, it symbolized that the USA won the Cold War and therefore the mainstream media around the world became anti-communism and pro-capitalism. The capitalist propaganda in the present makes a lot of people around the world accept the misconception of the split between the communist North and the capitalist South.
> 
> However, the misconception also comes from the unsolved situations between different classes in Korea. Most people believe that the split is due to the Cold War, but there is also another factor. After the end of WWII and Japanese colonization, different classes of Korean societies did not have a sense of how to rule Korea since before Japanese colonization it was ruled by an emperor. The landlords, tenants, capitalists, white-collar professionals, factory wage workers, and landless peasants all want to rule the country. It leads to an individual election in the North and the South which has different ideologies. This is what starts the Korean War and the misconception of the South and North Korea. Most people around the world just know that it is due to the Cold War but do not understand the complex situation of Korea after WWII.
